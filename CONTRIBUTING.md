### Development Guidelines

1. **Keep it simple**: This is a single-file browser application
2. **No build process**: Avoid introducing compilation steps
3. **Browser compatibility**: Support modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 80+, Safari 14+, Edge 80+)
4. **Performance first**: Consider large file handling and memory usage
5. **Privacy focused**: All processing must remain client-side

### Code Style

- **ES6+ JavaScript**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements
- **CSS Variables**: Use CSS custom properties for theming
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile compatibility
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Test with various file sizes**: Small (KB) to large (100MB+)
2. **Test different data formats**: Parquet, Arrow, Avro, JSONL, ORC, Delta Lake, Iceberg
3. **Browser testing**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
4. **Mobile testing**: Verify responsive design on mobile devices
5. **Performance testing**: Monitor memory usage with large files

### Submission Process

1. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Test thoroughly** across different browsers and file types

4. **Commit with clear messages**:
